## General info
Genral rules are commonly known. However, if you do not know them, I refer you to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))
Use arrows to change the direction on the snake. Food is spawning randomly on the map after you eat it.

Main goal of the project was to practice with a turtle library.
